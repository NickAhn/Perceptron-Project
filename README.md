<h1> Project3: Perceptron</h1>
The purpose of this project is to gain experience with implementing an Artificial Neural Network and its design choices that accompany using one.<br>

<h3>- Description:</h3> The Neural Network learns to recognize which continent or ocean a particular pair of latitude and longitude coordinates correspond to.
<br>

<h3>- Changing parameters of the code:</h3>
The top of the file main.py have global variables to modify the parameters of the perceptron, including:
<br><br>
- LEARNING_RATE: learning rate of perceptron
<br>
- THRESHOLD_RATE: threshold value
<br>
- EPOCHS: number of epochs for training values
<br>
- TRAINING_DATA: name of the .txt file containing the training data
<br>
- TEST_DATA: name of the .txt file containing the testing data

<h3>- Final Weights</h3>
The final weights (Best weights after training) can be found on the text file <i>trainedWeights.txt</i>
<br>
My best trained weights got a rate of 92.50588709677419% of perfectly classified examples using:
<br>
- LEARNING_RATE = 0.7
- THRESHOLD_RATE = 0.06
- EPOCHS = 70
